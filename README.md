# How i worked on this project

my goal was to create a bot that will handle's task's that scale along with a Discord server as it populates

*  used a package & DiscordAPI to communicate and gather all info in any server
* Implimented a Youtube command search

# How to navigate this project

* a simple code structure to search Youtube - [Youtube search code](https://github.com/EddySantos07/DiscordBot/blob/master/Backend/DiscordBot/YoutubeSrch/YoutubeSrch.js)

* kick command code that takes their id and the current guild/server and kicks the player violating any terms - [Kick command code](https://github.com/EddySantos07/DiscordBot/blob/master/Backend/DiscordBot/DiscordBotMethods/KickPerson.js)


# If i had more time I would change this

* fix the structure and fix any bugs that the bot cannot catch such as removing the ID portion for the kick command, so searching a player to kick would become easier

* add a AI portion to this bot so it can recommend certain functions to players!

* add a currency system

* refactor code / structure of code
